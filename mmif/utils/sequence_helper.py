"""
This module provides helpers for handling sequence labeling. Specifically, it provides

* a generalized label re-mapper for "post-binning" of labels
* conversion from a list of CLAMS annotations (with ``classification`` props) into a list of reals (scores by labels), can be combined with the label re-mapper mentioned above
* :py:meth:`mmif.utils.sequence_helper.smooth_short_intervals`: a simple smoothing algorithm by trimming "short" ridges or valleys

However, it DOES NOT provide 

* direct conversion between CLAMS annotations. For example, it does not directly handle stitching of ``TimePoint`` into ``TimeFrames``. 
* support for multi-class scenario, such as handling of _competing_ subsequence or overlapping labels.

Some functions can use optional external libraries (e.g., ``numpy``) for better performance. 
Hence, if you see a warning about missing optional packages, you might want to install them by running ``pip install mmif-python[seq]``.

    From a list of scores, a score threshold, and smoothing parameters, 
    identify the intervals of "positive" scores by smoothing the short 
    positive sequences ("pseq") and negative sequences ("nseq"). To decide 
    the positivity, first step is binarization of the scores by the 
    ``min_score`` threshold. Given ``Sr`` as "raw" input real-number scores 
    list, and ``min_score=0.5``,

        Explanation: ``min_nseq_size`` is used to smooth short sequences of 
        negative predictions. In this, zeros from t[7:10] are smoothed into 
        "one" I, while zeros from t[13:19] are kept as "zero" I. Note that 
        the "short" nseqs at the either ends (t[0:1]) are never smoothed.

        Explanation: ``min_pseq_size`` is used to smooth short sequences of
        positive predictions. In this example, the pseqs of ones from both 
        t[10:13] and t[19:20] are smoothed. Note that the "short" pseqs at 
        the either ends (t[19:20]) are always smoothed.

           S: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
           I: [0, 1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--0--0--0--0--0--0--0]
        
        Explanation: When two threshold parameters are working together,
        the algorithm will prioritize the smoothing of the nseqs over the 
        smoothing of the pseqs. Thus, in this example, the nseq t[7:10] 
        is first smoothed "up" before the pseq t[10:13] is smoothed "down", 
        resulting in a long final I.

           S: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
           I: [1--1--1--1--1--1--1, 0--0--0--0, 1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1--1]
        
        Explanation: Since smoothing of nseqs is prioritized, short pseqs at 
        the beginning or the end can be kept.
